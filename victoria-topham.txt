Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	A block element like <div> and <h1> always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. An inline element does not start on a new line. It only takes up as much space as it needs to.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	The value of the position is fixed.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	display: inline-block

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	Block by default: <div>, <p>, <h1>
	Inline by default: <a>, <span>
	Inline block: <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
	The box model is a series of concentric boxes used to describe positioning and spacing. The outermost box is the margin, then the border, then the padding, then the box containing the content itself. The fix for the box model is box-sizing:border-box.
